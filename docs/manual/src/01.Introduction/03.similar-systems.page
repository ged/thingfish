h2. Similar Systems

We considered several other systems which provide network data storage before we
decided to write ThingFish. Both Amazon's S3 and Danga's MogileFS provide the ability
to store and retrieve chunks of data through a network interface, but given our
specific needs, we found both systems to be of limited usefulness.


h3. "Amazon S3":http://aws.amazon.com/s3

Amazon's Simple Storage Service is probably the closest thing we've found to what we
need, but there are some limitations which it imposes which we couldn't live with:

<dl>
  	<dt>Metadata restrictions</dt>
  	<dd>We can't anticipate everything that we'd want to store as metadata, but we
    predict that it will be nearly as important as the file data itself. We want to
    store relations between files, summaries, ACLs, and other information which will
    easily not only exceed S3's current 2k limitation, but also require a rich set of
    operations independent of file data. S3's metadata is intimately coupled with the
    files themselves, and there is no facility for interacting with the metadata
    separately.</dd>

  	<dt>Not hosted locally</dt>
	<dd>
		<ul>
	   		<li>Trade secret issues</li>
	   		<li>Network response time</li>
		</ul>
	</dd>

 	<dt>Authentication</dt>
	<dd>No tie-ins to local authentication mechanisms (ldap)</dd>
</dl>

Motivation was cheap disk, not easy access

 - Proprietary client API 
 - Database dependency
 - Needless complexity
