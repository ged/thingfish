To fire up the bare-bones server so you can start playin' around:

	$ sudo rake install_dependencies
	$ ./run

The run script sets up the daemon to load its configuration from the 'etc/thingfish.conf' file,
which by default starts ThingFish in the foreground, and stores all uploaded data in memory.

After starting it, you should be able to point your browser at:

	http://localhost:3474/

and see the server's toplevel (completely optional) web interface. 


For more information about customizing and running your server, please see the included
documentation.

You can generate the manual and the API documentation by running:

	$ rake docs

These docs are now available for your viewing pleasure at:

	http://localhost:3474/manual/
	http://localhost:3474/api/
