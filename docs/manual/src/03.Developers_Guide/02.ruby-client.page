h2. Using the Ruby ThingFish Client Library

Not sure about this yet, but perhaps it will look something like this:

{example: {
	filename: examples/clientapi.rb, 
	language: ruby,
	testable: true,
	caption: A proposed client library API
	}}
	

h3. Creating the Client

The @ThingFish::Client@ class is the main interface to the ThingFish store. It can be used to upload, download, and query the server for resources. 

The first step is to configure the client, which you can do by providing the connection parameters as either distinct values or a URL:

{example: {
	filename: examples/instantiating.rb,
	language: ruby,
	testable: true,
	caption: Creating the client object
  }}

h3. Fetching Resources

Once you have a configured client object, you can fetch resources from the server via their UUID:

{example: {
	filename: examples/fetching.rb,
	caption: Fetching a resource by UUID,
	language: ruby,
	testable: true
  }}
