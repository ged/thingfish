h2. Server Architecture

The server has five major components:

</notextile>


h3. Daemon

The daemon is the container for the other parts, and is the class that is executed
when the server starts up. On startup, the daemon loads the configuration file, reads
it, then loads the configured plugin components and assembles them into the chain of
objects that defines how ThingFish functions.

After startup, the daemon is also the component which handles incoming connections
and manages the cleanup process when it is shutting down.

In comparison to the other components, there's really nothing to customize in the
Daemon class itself. The other components are all pluggable -- that is, you can
define your own just by adding an appropriately-named file to the right directory.


h3. Handlers

Handlers are the main workhorses of the system. They provide the logic for how to
handle any of the various requests sent to the server. ThingFish has one of these
by default, called the @DefaultHandler@, which handlers requests for the index view
(@http://thingfish-server/@) and provides the functionality for uploads and downloads
of file data.

The @DefaultHandler@ is always loaded and can't be omitted or replaced via the
config. If you want to modify it, you'll have to write your own Daemon class to do
so.

You can, however, add one or more other handlers to the chain that will handle
requests for metadata, search strategies, or anything else you might want to
do. ThingFish comes with a number of these that can be loaded via the config.

See the <a href="{relocatable: writing-handlers.page}">Writing Handlers</a> section
for more on how to do this.


h3. Filters

Filters are a bit like handlers, but they don't create or accept content themselves;
they transform outgoing content to a form which the requester has asked for if it
isn't in that format already (HTTP content negotiation), or automatically extract
metadata from incoming file data.

See the <a href="{relocatable: writing-filters.page}">Writing Filters</a> section for
more information.


h3. Filestore

The Filestore is the data-storage backend, the system which stores the actual
file data in some storage medium behind the scenes. ThingFish comes with two
different ones: a memory-based one that stores everything in memory, and a simple
filesystem-based one that stores everything on disk in a hashed directory tree.

For more about writing a custom Filestore, see the <a href="{relocatable:
writing-filestores.page}">Writing FileStores</a> section.


h3. Metastore

The Metastore is the backend system which stores searchable metadata about the
files. ThingFish comes with two metastore backends which are complimentary to
the included filestore plugins -- one that stores everything in an in-memory
datastructure, and one that stores it on disk.

The <a href="{relocatable: writing-metastores.page}">Writing MetaStores</a> section
contains instructions on how to write your own.
