== Installation

=== Requirements

ThingFish is written in ruby, and is tested using version 1.8.6:

  * Ruby (>= 1.8.6): http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/

Other versions may work, but are not tested.

=== Ruby Modules

There are two ways you can install ThingFish. The easiest is to use RubyGems:

  $ sudo gem install -y thingfish

If you'd rather install from source, you'll need these:

  * PluginFactory (>= 1.0.3): http://deveiate.org/projects/PluginFactory
  * UUIDTools (>= 1.0.0): http://rubyforge.org/projects/uuidtools/

Once these are installed:

  $ tar -zxvf thingfish-0.X.N.tgz
  $ cd thingfish-0.X.N
  $ su -
  # rake install

If you want to help out with development, run tests, or generate documentation, 
you'll need a few more things:

  * RSpec (>= 1.1.11): http://rspec.rubyforge.org/
  * rcov (>= 0.8.1): http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?rcov
  * lockfile (>= 1.4.3): http://codeforpeople.com/lib/ruby/lockfile/
  * rcodetools (>= 0.7.0): http://eigenclass.org/hiki/rcodetools
  * Redcloth (>= 3.0.4): http://whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/redcloth/
  * ultraviolet (>= 0.10.2) http://ultraviolet.rubyforge.org/

If you have RubyGems installed, you can install these automatically via the 
+install_dependencies+ task of the Rakefile:

  $ sudo rake install_dependencies
