== Thingfish::StatusHandler

A handler plugin that displays server status and statistics about some of its URIs.

== Dependencies

No additional requirements.

== Configuration

To run this handler in your ThingFish, add a 'status' section to the 'handlers' 
section of your config file:

  - status:
      uris: /status
      stats_uris: [/]
      resource_dir:
      template_name: index.rhtml

=== Config Keys ===

[uris]::
  The URIs to register the handler at.
[stats_uris]::
  URIs which should have statistics gathered.
[resource_dir]::
  The directory which contains the statistics template.
[template_name]::
  The name of the template to use for the statistics view.

=== Resources ===

This handler uses a template for its status output, which installed by default in the 
'thingfish/statushandler' directory under your Ruby's datadir. If you wish to 
customize the output you can modify that file, or override the resource directory 
or the template name in the handler's options.
