= Thingfish::FilesystemFileStore

A disk filesystem-based ThingFish FileStore plugin.

This FileStore stores resources on disk in a hierarchy of hashed directories. It uses
NFS-safe locking for writes, and should be threadsafe.

== Dependencies

 $ sudo gem install lockfile

== Configuration

To run this handler in your ThingFish, set the 'name' value in your config file's 'filestore'
section to 'filesystem'.

=== Resources

This handler uses a template for its status output, which installed by default in the 
'thingfish/statushandler' directory under your Ruby's datadir. If you wish to 
customize the output you can modify that file, or override the resource directory 
or the template name in the handler's options.
