== Thingfish::UploadHandler

A handler that accepts and unwraps multipart form uploads, as documented at
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc1341/7_2_Multipart.html

== Configuration

To run this handler in your ThingFish, add a 'upload' section to the 'plugins' 
section of your config file:

    - upload:
        uris: /upload
        resource_dir: plugins/thingfish-uploadhandler/resources


=== Config Keys

[uris]::
  The URIs to register the handler at.
[+bufsize+]::
    The size of the buffer to use when reading incoming data (in bytes).	
    Defaults to ThingFish::UploadHandler::DEFAULT_BUFSIZE
[+spooldir+]::
    The directory in which to store uploaded resources before they are injected
    into the filestore.
    Defaults to ThingFish::UploadHandler::DEFAULT_SPOOLDIR
[resource_dir]::

=== Resources

This handler uses a template for its output, which installed by default in the
'thingfish/uploadhandler' directory under your Ruby's datadir. If you wish to
customize the output you can modify that file, or override the resource directory or
the template name in the handler's options.
