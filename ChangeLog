   Merge of the last 5 months of [log:thingfish/branches/evented-backend@619 work].

   Among the main features in this merge:

   * Removal of the Mongrel dependency, in favor of our own ConnectionManager and Handler dispatch strategy. (This was

   after heavy exploration of rack, ebb, rev, io-reactor, and eventmachine.)

   * The status handler has been removed. (it subclassed a Mongrel handler)

   * DefaultHandler now falls back to use global 'resource_dir' configuration

   * Use symbols for methods with Request.http_method()

   * Startup actions for filestores and metastores renamed to 'on_startup' to denote event instead of action

   * Documentation updates (more on the way)

   * Config file format has changed for handlers, see example files for details

   * Added connection-level profiling

   * Added connection pipelining (woo woo!)

   * Updated 'ab' patches for latest binaries (benchmarking)

   Limit the sequel connection pool to a single connection.  The default
   (10) interacts badly rubythreads and transactional queries (both
   postgres and sequel produce locking errors.).

    * MP3 plugin:

    - Added some diagnostic logging for album-art extraction
    * Fixed a bug in the formupload handler's template when uploaded files don't have an associated 
    title.
    * Wrapped Rakefile tasklib loading in better diagnostics
    * Renamed the 'rdoc' tasklib to 'docs' and moved the manual task to that library to eliminate the

    resource IOs as well as entity bodies.
    * Added a 'bench' shortcut for 'benchmarks:all' to the benchmark tasklib
    * Fixed a typo in ThingFish::Client API docs.
    * Changed the way recursion works in ThingFish::Request#yield_each_resource -- no longer (needs) 
    uses Enumerable::Enumerator, and eliminated newly-appended resources from sometimes being 
    yielded back to the block. Thanks to Jeremiah Chase for pairing with me while tracking this
    down.

    * Add ThingFish::FIlesystemFileStore caching of sizes to help with

    startup speed when quotas are enabled.

    uid is set.

    * Allow Rakefile library loading from external sources (fix path

    * Break manual and benchmark class methods into library files, so

    the actual task actions are logically separated.

    * Allow config object assignment for keys that aren't part of the

    original structure.

    * Add a new help methods, 'find_pattern_in_pipe()', which searches

    the output of a system call for a supplied regexp.

    * Remove the totally unnecessary rspec_files() method from helpers.

    * Lots of Benchmark reorganizations for storage of datasets.

    * Added additional 'ab' functionality to benchmark tasks.

    * Updated local 'ab' patch to reflect

-- Thu, 24 Apr 2008 14:25:40 -0000 by mgranger (r519) -----
   Added:   experiments/migrate_metastore.rb (new)

    * Adding a one-off little wrapper script to demo metastore migration. This 
    refs #16, but doesn't close it, as it's not really a general tool for
    migrations, nor does it facilitate migrating filestores. Once we figure out
    how to specify the source and target metastores on the command line, perhaps
    we'll move it to bin/ and close the ticket.

     - ThingFish::MetaStore#each_resource
     - ThingFish::MetaStore#dump_store
     - ThingFish::MetaStore#load_store

     and/or URIs.
     * Made the `start` script take an optional config file argument. Thanks to Sho
     for the suggestion.

   * Fixed a weird bug in the ThingFish::SequelMetaStore#get_all_property_values method under FreeBSD.
   Still not sure why this happens, but the fix should work everywhere.
   * Reworked some tests in the rfc2822 filter that broke in different timezones (again! grrrr). Still
   need to re-add the specific header matches to the test for 'mixed' content.

    Worst case scenario, this patch will at least let us use

    'ab' for more than the most basic HTTP methods.

    Gross... but I'm not about to re-engineer 'ab' right now.

   Changed: misc/rake/benchmark.rb

   Committing more work on the benchmark Rake task. It's outputting stats via
   `ab` currently, but since ab can't do PUT or DELETE requests it's of limited
   usefulness. We're investigating replacing the actual core with `httperf` or
   Apache's `flood`.

            spec/lib/metastore_behavior.rb (and 7 other/s)

    * Fixed the dependencies installer for RubyGems > 0.9.something. Apparently 
    the only reason this worked was that RubyGems didn't clean up files
    from older installs as part of its updater. D'oh.
    * Added ThingFish::MetaStore#dump_store for both debugging the contents of a store and for future
    migration tools.

    * Allow end users to decide between normal text/html output and xhtml

    strict.  We default to text/html, so 'out-of-the-box' features like

    multi upload javascript and info viewing under safari work.  If you

    prefer strict mode, set 'use_html_strict_mimetype' to true in your

    config.  Closes #38.

    * Refactor ThingFish::MetaStore APIs:

    #find_by_exact_properties() --> #find_exact_uuids()

    #find_by_matching_properties() --> #find_matching_uuids()

    Metastores can implement either one.  You can inherit the intersect logic

    and use find_*_uuids(), or completely override find_by_*_properties() if

    your metastore has a more robust way to gather UUIDs.  This removes

    all the duplicate logic in the current metastores.

    * Move a good portion of the SQL into constants, in the SQLite3 metastore.

    * Michael is naughty too.

    * Minor typo correction in Filter template.

    * Remove errant space in the 'start' script.

    * Correct my destruction of the RDF metastore spike.  Also keep a commented

    SQLite backend storage example.   Add example SparQL search.

   Deleted: etc/thingfish.conf-advanced

    * Added a hack to the rfc2822 filter to show mail in the browser. This should really be done
    in either the HTML filter or in a dedicated text filter. This will likely be removed at a
    later date.
    * Finished up the 'simple' metastore interface in the RDF metastore. The search interface needs
    some cleanup still, but it's now minimally-functional as a simple store. All the really cool
    stuff is around the corner.
    * Factored the glob->regexp function from the marshalled metastore into the base MetaStore.
    * Updated/fixed a bunch of manual stuff. Thanks once again to Sho Fukamachi for noticing.
    * Added a multiple query-arg test to the metastore shared behavior
    * Added a big disclaimer to the header of the `start` script.
    * Renamed all the configs for consistency, added an ignore for etc/thingfish.conf to avoid 
    clobbering Sho's config every time, and moved the old etc/thingfish.conf to 
    etc/thingfish.conf.example. Closes #47.

    requests to fail.
    * Checkpoint of a bit more progress on the RDF metastore.
    * Fixed up the tf_plugin spec templates with updated boilerplate code.
    * Fixed some broken paths in the manual-generation Rake task. Thanks to
    Sho Fukamachi for reporting this. Fixes #46.
    * Added missing plugin dependency for the RFC2822 filter to the `install_plugin_dependencies` task.
    * Rewind bodies explicitly again to work around the fact that duped IOs that are read from still
    have their underlying FILE* position modified when read from. Refs #26.
    * Added a UUID_URN pattern for matching UUID URNs.

    * Added HTML-escaping to values in search result links.
    * Temporarily set the XHTML mimetype to 'text/html' to work around bugs in our markup until we can
    fix them/add mimetype configurability. This should address #38 and fix the multi-upload

   This is the big "make sure ThingFish works out of the box" commit.

   Thanks to Sho Fukamachi <sho.fukamachi@gmail.com> for his excellent suggestions.

   * Normalize plugin Rakefile and README content, and ensure they reflect reality.

   * Make sure that the default 'thingfish.conf' file uses the minimal plugin set that

   most people would find useful while experimenting/evaluating ThingFish.

   * Moved the -really- minimal config example to 'etc/thingfish.conf-minimal', for

   reference.

   * Added a 'QUICKSTART' document to aid with initial setup, and steer people

   to the Manual for more advanced usage.

   * Fix for the /search handler javascript, for the case where the JSON plugin is

   not present.  (Fallsthrough to HTML view.)

   * Removed conflicting LICENSE file.  Whoops.

   * Removed webgen from the list of default dependencies.

   * Added some command-line blurbs for the intended use of the 'start' script.

   * Fixed a bug in ThingFish::Request#query_args -- use the uri accessor instead of the

   instance variable, which in some cases was uninitialized.

    * Integer-ify EXIF::TIFF::Orientation objects before storing them into the metastore.

    * Stub tests for content-disposition Time.rfc822, so parsing the date string doesn't

    change to the timezone of the person running the test.  Closes #40.

    * Cache ID lookups in the Sequel metastore, to be less 'chatty' with the database

    with repetitive queries.   

    * Improve compatibility with NULL inserts and Postgres.  (Thanks Michael!)

    * Temp fix for mimetype detection for the ruby client.

    Fixes bug:37.

    * Force metadata values to strings for equality/regexp comparisons

    in ThingFish::MemoryMetastore.  Fixes bug:36.

    * Automatically create the spooldir if it doesn't already exist

    during multipart mime parsing.  Closes issue:34.

    * Rename plugin Rakefile PKG_NAME(s) to reflect new plugin naming conventions.

    * Completion of the Sequel metastore plugin, along with various cleanups.

    This now opens up the possibility for Postgres/MySQL/etc simple metastores!

    * Added an additional Log object that only allows debug messages.  This

    eases debug output for libraries that accept Logger objects directly.

    * More work on the client library. Coverage sucks at the moment, and there's still big gaps, but it
    has been far too long since I've committed.
    * Implemented a new testing strategy for ThingFish::Daemon, which involved factoring out the
    request/response-generation code into a separate method and changing the monkeypatch to follow
    suit.
    * Implemented log formatting, with the added benefit of making the RSpec output include
    pretty-formatted logs if run under TextMate.
    * Made the 'svn:ci' task update with --ignore-externals turned on to avoid being able to commit
    using it if there's a problem with an external.

    * Don't modify the underlying data structure on YAML stringification.

    * Explicit JSON content tests.

    * Freeze all test constants, hopefully will help us catch test ordering bugs sooner.

            lib/thingfish/filter/ruby.rb (and 8 other/s)


    * Change the response behavior on conversion filters --

    if we can't convert into json/xml/yaml/ruby/etc...

    it's indicative of a problem, and shouldn't be absorbed.

    * Be more explicit with what errors we absorb on request filters.

    * Make sure that YAML output is stringified, regardless of Object type.

    (Sticking to our language agnostic principles... if you want the

    advantages of Ruby serialized metadata values, use the ruby filter!)

    * Allow the IPAddr class to be XML Serialized.

    * Conversion filters (as a general rule) shouldn't set response.status.

    * Set Content-Type on DELETE to / to text/plain

    * Responses to / PUT/POST return the extracted metadata, so uploads don't

    need to perform a second request to fetch that data.

    * Added "safety" methods to metastores.  These methods are passthroughs to 'real' property updates,
    but first remove any properties that ThingFish relies on for Filestore consistency.
    * Added two additional metastore API methods. 
    - update_properties(), updates a list of properties, vs set_properties() which is a replace
    - delete_resource(), removes all properties for a uuid and the properties under it.
    This was the previous behavior of delete_properties(), which now deletes only the specified
    list.

    * Converted handlers to all use the new HTML filter for output instead of their own
    self-contained templates.
    * Added an option to the XMLFilter to disable Tidy entirely so you can run it without having
    the Ruby 'tidy' library installed.
    * Added/cleaned up some Rakefile stuff:
    - Added a 'style' namespace that will be used for style checks of code pending committal.
    - Updated the development dependencies. Still missing the filter dependencies, but 
    I hope we can work out how to skip filter tests which fail because of dependency
    issues.
    - Added an inline monkeypatch for RSpec's autotester that allows the 'spec' command-line
    program to live anywhere in your path, not just /usr/bin and ./bin.
    - Fixed up the autotest task to work after the re-arrangement of stuff in the specs directories.
    - Read the ThingFish version from the library file instead of having it hardcoded in the 
    Rakefile.
    * Added some work on the 'running' and 'connecting' docs.
    * Changed format of logging and made it show the logging class in debug level.

    * Checkpoint commit for additional metadata handler functionality.

    * Show all metadata for a given uuid

    * Show all metadata values for a given metadata key

    There is still some slightly funky bits that will get fixed asap:

    * metadata and search erb templates shouldn't link to each other explicitly,

    but rather check that the other is registered, and use the registered uri.

    * metadata/search have no index content. (probably need their own resource dirs)

    * Add new metastore API: get_all_property_values()

    * Added to SQLite, memory, and marshalled metastores.

    * Move searchhandler search results to top of HTML page, link to metadata.

    * Use downcased strings instead of regexps within ThingFish::ExifFilter and ThingFish::Mp3Filter
    * Added additional sqlite pragmas that might speed things up.  We need benchmarks.  :)
    * Correct daemon logging on uploads to reflect correct metastore keys
    * request#query_args() now returns 'nil' on defined keys without explicit value, instead of 'true'.
    * request#get_body_and_metadata() made public again to support the uploading of multipart bodies -without- parsing.

   Merge from branches/upload_handler_merge rev 350.

   This branch was originally intended to merge the upload plugin into the defaulthandler.

   We changed our minds halfway through (made defaulthandler way too complex),

   but came out with some fun stuff anyway:

   * Move the upload form into its own erb template for easier future usage

   (maybe in the index_content with some thickbox yum!)

   * Move  parts of store_resource up into daemon.rb so uploadhandler and defaulthandler

   don't have duplicated code.

   * Updated jquery to 1.2.1, and moved it from the uploadhandler's resource directory into

   the main static resource dir.

   * Sort list of files uploaded to /upload by title.

   * Organized javascript and style sheets into their own respective directories.

   * Index page cleanup

   * Added the HTTP status to the response error exception, rather than creating a new

   error class for each response status.

   * Added ThingFish::Request#metadata hash to support extraction filters

   * Added caching of query arg lookup to ThingFish::Request

   * Added ThingFish::Request#each_body, which does upload entity body extraction and metadata

   merge. This was extracted from the DefaultHandler to provide this functionality for more

   than just the upload and default handlers. Extraction filters, for example, will probably

   need access to uploaded entities before they're extracted by the handlers, so consolidating

   this in one spot made sense.

   * Added ThingFish::Request#is_ajax_request?, which may be convenient at a future date.

   * Firefox seems to treat the presense of a content_disposition header as if it always contains

   the 'attachment' keyword.  Changed the conditional to affect the whole header instead

   of only the keyword.

    * SQLite3 Metastore:
    - Refactored schema-loading
    - Added schema revisioning via the 'user_version' pragma (though no 
    action is currently taken if the schema is out of date)
    - Reworked the tests to run a bit faster
    - Added a #clear method
    * Added some examples of storing a resource to the developer section of the 
    manual
    * Some more little updates to the client docs
    * More RSpec 0.9.x conversion
    * Fixed the coverage percentage verification rake task
    * Factored the #listener= callback up into the base handler so all
    handlers have a reference to the metastore and filestore if they need 
    them.
    * Implemented fetching in the client library
    * Removed a few spec examples which tested stuff outside of its area of
    responsibility
    * Fleshed out ThingFish::Resource to include constructors for both 
    Net::HTTPResponse objects and IOs.
    * Added a fixturing function for generating HTTP responses to the constants 
    module.
    * Factored out subversion helpers into a new rake task lib

            spec/client_spec.rb (and 8 other/s)

    * Factored resource-loading out into a new mixin: ThingFish::ResourceLoader
    * Renamed the ThingFish::StaticResources mixin to 
    ThingFish::StaticResourcesHandler for clarity about what it actually does
    * Moved the initial schema for the SQLite3 metastore into a resource
    that's loadable on demand
    * Client library now implements #store.
    * New class ThingFish::Resource for encapsulating a chunk of data fetched
    from the server and its associated metadata.
    * Added a synopsis for ThingFish::Daemon
    * Added a command-line client tool that uses ThingFish::Client instead of
    doing all the HTTP itself [source:trunk/bin/thingfish2 bin/thingfish2.
    This should eventually replace [source:trunk/bin/thingfish bin/thingfish].
