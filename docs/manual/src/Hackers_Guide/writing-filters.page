h3. How's a filter different than a handler?

For a given URI, a handler is what performs the actual response to the
client.  Filters are chainable code that has the opportunity to look at
and optionally modify both the request and the response, regardless of
URI.

We like to think of filters that operate on incoming data as
'extraction' filters, as they commonly pull more data out of uploaded
files for the metastore.  For example, detecting and storing id3
information for MP3 uploads.

Filters that operate on the response could be thought of as 'conversion'
filters, such as a filter designed to dynamically convert a TIFF file to
a JPEG via the client's @Accept@ header.

h3. Rest of this coming soon...
