== Thingfish::RdfMetastore

A ThingFish metastore based on an RDF knowledge-base.

== Dependencies

We currently do not support the Redland RDF rubygem, as it's several years out of date at the time
of this writing.  Instead, we recommend installing the version available from http://librdf.org.

 $ wget http://download.librdf.org/source/redland-VERSION.tar.gz
 $ wget http://download.librdf.org/source/redland-bindings-VERSION.tar.gz
 $ tar -zxf redland-VERSION.tar.gz
 $ tar -zxf redland-bindings-VERSION.tar.gz
 $ cd redland-VERSION
 $ ./configure && make && sudo make install
 $ cd ../redland-bindings-VERSION
 $ ./configure --with-ruby && make && sudo make install
