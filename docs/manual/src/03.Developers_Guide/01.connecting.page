h2. Connecting to the Server

There are several options for connecting: you can use a client library if one has
been written for your language, or you can use HTTP to talk to the server directly.

h3. The Basics

To test out the particulars of your connection, you can connect to the daemon with a
web browser by pointing it at the URL:

http://your-thingfish-server:3474/

It will (by default) display a page describing the configuration of the server,
including an overview of the API for connecting to it. Because the server is
extensible and overridable using plugins, the particulars of your server might be
different than the ones described here, but the basic upload/download REST API should
remain consistent.
