h2. Intended Audience

This manual is primarily for three different kinds of people: System Administrators, Web Developers, and ThingFish Plugin Developers.

h3. System Administrators

If you're thinking about setting up a ThingFish server on your local network, you'll probably want to know how to configure the daemon, how to start it up, what maintenance it requires, and what troubleshooting steps you can take if something doesn't work.

You can skim the rest of this introduction to familiarize yourself with the structure of the system, but the <a href="{relocatable: ../02.Getting_Started}">Getting Started</a> section describes installation and setup procedures, so you should probably start there if you just want to get to work.

You will also want to refer to the <a href="{relocatable: ../05.Maintenance}">Maintenance</a> and <a href="{relocatable: ../06.Troubleshooting-FAQs}">Troubleshooting and FAQs</a> sections.


h3. Web Developers

If you're a web developer seeking to use an installed ThingFish server, the <a href="{relocatable: ../03.Developers_Guide}">Developer's Guide</a> is for you. You'll most likely want to skim the rest of introduction as well, as it describes several important concepts that will make using the service a bit more intuitive.


h3. Plugin Developers

If ThingFish isn't exactly what you need, chances are you can whip it into shape with a few plugins. ThingFish is made to be customized, and the <a href="{relocatable: ../04.Hackers_Guide}">Hacker's Guide</a> is the roadmap to the internals you'll need to know about (and probably some you don't) when extending or replacing its built-in functionality.
