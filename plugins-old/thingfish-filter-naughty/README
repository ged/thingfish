== Thingfish::NaughtyFilter

My purpose is to attempt destruction and chaos.  I defile your
bodies. (Request and response bodies, that is.)

Ok.  This is for end-to-end request and response filter chaining, to
ensure that a filter in the middle of the chain can't adversely affect
the expected operation of the server.

As we identify more 'bad behavior' with usage, we'll add it to this filter.

== Configuration

There is really no reason to use this in everyday ThingFish.  Please don't.

=== Config Keys ===

[enable]:: 
  yes, I understand this is just for testing
